MVC, MVP, MVI, MVVM, and VIPER patterns

1. MVC (Model-View-Controller):

🛎Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
🔎View: Displays the data (UI) and sends user actions to the controller.
Controller: Receives input from the view, processes it (often interacting with the model), and returns the output to the view.
🧲Usage: Common in web applications (e.g., Ruby on Rails, Django) and some desktop applications.

✅️Pros: Clear separation of concerns, straightforward data flow.

📛Cons: Can lead to tightly coupled components, making testing and maintenance more difficult.

2. MVP (Model-View-Presenter):

🛎Model: Represents the data and business logic.
🔎View: User interface that displays data and sends user actions to the presenter.
🪛Presenter: Acts as a middleman between the model and the view, handling user input, updating the view, and manipulating the model.
🧲Usage: Often used in applications with complex UI logic, such as Android applications.

✅️Pros: Improved testability since the presenter can be tested independently of the view.

📛Cons: Can lead to boilerplate code and increased complexity.

3. MVI (Model-View-Intent):

🛎Model: Represents the state of the application.
🔎View: Displays the UI and renders the state to the user.
🔧Intent: Represents the user's actions or intents that can change the state.
🧲Usage: Gaining popularity in Android development and reactive programming paradigms.

✅️Pros: Unidirectional data flow simplifies state management and testing.

📛Cons: May require a deeper understanding of reactive programming concepts.

4. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):

🛎Model: Represents the data and business logic.
🔎View: The UI layer that displays data and binds to the ViewModel.
🔦ViewModel: Acts as a bridge between the model and the view, exposing data for the view and handling user actions.
🧲Usage: Commonly used in technologies like WPF, Xamarin, and Angular.

✅️Pros: Facilitates data binding, leading to a more responsive UI and easier testing.

📛Cons: Can lead to complex interactions if not managed properly.

5. VIPER (View-Interactor-Presenter-Entity-Router):

🔎View: Displays the UI and receives user input.
🪛Interactor: Contains business logic and communicates with the entity.
🔧Presenter: Acts as a mediator between the view and the interactor, formatting data for display.
🗞Entity: Represents the data model.
🗂Router: Manages navigation and routing between different views.
🧲Usage: Primarily used in iOS development.

✅️Pros: Highly modular and promotes separation of concerns, making it easier to test and maintain.

📛Cons: Can lead to a lot of boilerplate code and may be overkill for simple applications.
